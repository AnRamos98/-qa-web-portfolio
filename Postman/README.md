**What Exactly Is Postman?**

Postman is an all-in-one API platform used not only by developers, but also by testers. It helps us build, test, and manage APIs in a simple and intuitive way.
Sounds good, right?

This amazing tool streamlines the entire API lifecycle by providing a clean, user-friendly interface where you can:
• Send and inspect HTTP requests
• Test API behavior using automated scripts
• Organize and document your work
• Collaborate easily with your team
• Monitor API performance over time

In short: Postman makes working with APIs easier, faster, and much more pleasant,  whether you're a beginner or an experienced QA.

Learning how to use a new platform doesn’t have to be a daunting task.
Sure, sometimes it feels overwhelming at first, but when we break things down and explain them in a simple, practical way, everything becomes much easier. And the best part? The knowledge sticks.
So, with that spirit in mind, let’s walk through how to use Postman, step by step, in a friendly and straightforward way.

First of all, we ’ll need to install Postman
(of course!! otherwise we wouldn’t be able to do anything, and we wouldn’t be able to get our hands dirty like we love! 😄)
Just type “Postman” into Google’s search bar and click on the first link that appears,
or go directly to their official website: https://www.postman.com/
Once you're there, choose your operating system, select the correct system type, and the installer (.exe, .dmg, etc.) will start downloading automatically.
